# ML Performance Analyzer

README in progress. This project is split into two parts:

-   `main` contains the full application to serve our model on GKE
-   `chat` is the directory to run a simple Streamlit application targetting the inference endpoint set up in `main`.

See the individual READMEs in each section.
