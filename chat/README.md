## Chat UI (Streamlit)

First set up your virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the streamlit application. Note, this assumes that you have port-forwarded the inference endpoint to localhost.

```
streamlit run chat_ui.py
```
